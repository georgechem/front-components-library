Spinner Component:

Exemplary component can be used:
```javascript
import Spinner from './spinner/Spinner.js';
// Create spinner (Every component need canvas !)
const spinner = new Spinner(canvas);
```
Instance of previously created canvas is needed in every created component!
Next we add component to canvas
```javascript
// Add spinner to canvas
canvas.addComponent(spinner);
```
Since now component is added and drawn on the canvas. Every component need to implement draw method
```javascript
draw = () => {
    // Neede for canvas to draw component on the screen
    // Here you can invoke other methods neded by your component
}
```
To remove component from canvas use:
```javascript
// Component can be removed
canvas.removeComponent(spinner);
```
